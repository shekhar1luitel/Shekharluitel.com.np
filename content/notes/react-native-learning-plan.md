excerpt: My 6-week roadmap for becoming productive with React Native while honoring accessibility and performance.
---
<p>I spend most days in backend code, but hybrid mobile is on the roadmap. Here's how I'm approaching React Native without losing sight of user experience.</p>
<h2>Weeks 1–2: Fundamentals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Study Flexbox layout in the context of React Native's styling.</li>
  <li>Build a simple flashcard app syncing with a FastAPI backend.</li>
  <li>Audit the accessibility tree using the built-in inspector.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Weeks 3–4: Native integrations</h2>
<p>I plan to implement offline storage with SQLite, experiment with push notifications, and wire up a CI pipeline that runs unit tests on pull requests.</p>
<h2>Weeks 5–6: Ship a pilot</h2>
<p>The final sprint focuses on shipping an MVP for Loksewa learners: offline quizzes, sync-on-connect, and analytics instrumentation. Success equals a small group of testers using the app daily with <strong>zero</strong> crash reports.</p>
