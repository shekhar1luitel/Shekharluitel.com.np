<section>
  <p>The University Grants Commission requires rigorous documentation for institutional accreditation. Our viewer pulls scattered spreadsheets, PDFs, and KPIs into a single searchable workspace.</p>
  <p>I led the migration from legacy PHP scripts to Laravel with modular policies. Role-based access control ensures auditors, faculty, and administrators see the right context without leaking sensitive student data.</p>
  <p>Timeline views highlight deadlines, while quick filters surface pending actions. The result: teams cut preparation time by 60% and reduced audit follow-up loops dramatically.</p>
